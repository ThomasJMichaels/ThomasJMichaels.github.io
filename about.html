                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p class="bio">Thomas J. Michaels is a musician in the Boston area currently attending Berklee College of Music. He is pursuing a degree in Contemporary Writing and Production with a minor in Conducting.</p>
                <p class="bio">Thomas began studying music at the age of 4 with his first instrument being guitar, and then later switching to piano. He soon fell into musical theatre, training as a performer through high school, but realized his passions lay more with music. With his involvement in musical theatre, he discovered his interests in arranging, music direction, accompanying, and sound production/music technology. Thomas also played in percussion ensemble through his youth and was able to explore his interests in arranging and writing of instrumental music. In 2016, Thomas was accepted to the University of North Carolina School of the Arts to study piano performance and spent his senior year of high school and first year of undergraduate studies focusing on his facility and artistry as a pianist. He then transferred to Berklee in 2018. </p>
                <p class="bio">In recent years, Thomas has been an active member of the music scene, in-demand for his wide set of skills. He has been seen soloing on Gershwin’s ”Rhapsody in Blue” with the Berklee Motion Picture Orchestra. conducting Blumenthal Performing Arts’ production “Charlotte Squawks 15,” and as a collaborative pianist for the Western Piedmont Youth Quartet on their trip to perform in the Altenburg Music Festival in Altenburg Germany. </p>
